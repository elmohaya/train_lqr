# ðŸ”§ Critical Bug Fix: Data Normalization

## Problem Discovered

The training was showing extremely high losses (15,000-40,000) because **data was not being normalized during training**, even though normalization statistics were computed and stored.

### Root Cause

1. **Data Generation**: Computed normalization stats but stored RAW data
2. **Data Loader**: Loaded normalization stats but NEVER applied them
3. **Training**: Model received unnormalized data with huge values (-2686 to +4001)
4. **Result**: Massive losses, heavily clipped gradients (60-140x), no learning

## Impact

### Before Normalization Fix:
```
Batch 1:
  Loss: 15,781
  Targets: mean=-0.53, std=67.8, min=-2686, max=1793
  Predictions: mean=0.11, std=0.91, min=-3.5, max=2.6
  Max sample loss: 7,217,821
  Max gradient norm: 111 (clipped to 1.0 â†’ 111x reduction!)
```

### After Normalization Fix:
```
Batch 1:
  Loss: 8.8  (1,792x better!)
  Targets: mean=0.03, std=1.5, min=-15, max=54
  Predictions: mean=0.10, std=0.96, min=-4.0, max=2.8
  Max sample loss: 1,186  (6,000x better!)
  Max gradient norm: 2.9 (clipped to 1.0 â†’ only 2.9x reduction)
```

## Solution

Modified `data_loader.py` to normalize data ON-THE-FLY during batch loading:

```python
# Normalize states (in input sequences)
state_dim = self.state_mean.shape[0]
input_seq_states = input_seq[:, :, :state_dim]
input_seq_encoding = input_seq[:, :, state_dim:]
input_seq_states_norm = (input_seq_states - self.state_mean) / self.state_std
input_seq = np.concatenate([input_seq_states_norm, input_seq_encoding], axis=-1)

# Normalize controls (targets)
control = (control - self.control_mean) / self.control_std
```

## Expected Training Progress

With normalized data, expect:

| Epoch | Expected Loss |
|-------|---------------|
| 1     | 5-10         |
| 5     | 2-5          |
| 10    | 1-3          |
| 20    | 0.5-2.0      |
| 50    | < 0.5        |

## Best Practices Reminder

1. **ALWAYS normalize data** for neural networks
2. **Inputs**: Zero mean, unit variance
3. **Targets**: Zero mean, unit variance
4. **Predictions**: Denormalize for deployment/evaluation

## Files Modified

- `data_loader.py`: Added on-the-fly normalization in `__next__()` method

## Status

âœ… **FIXED** - Training now uses properly normalized data
